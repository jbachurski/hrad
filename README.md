This was my fun attempt at automatic differentation with funky types in Haskell.

Mostly based on this paper and other public resources: http://conal.net/papers/beautiful-differentiation/beautiful-differentiation.pdf

Also has some other insights and an attempt at implementing similar type instances to perform gradient descent.
